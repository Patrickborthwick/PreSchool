                    Battle Pre-School was formed in 1969 and sessions were held
                    in the sport pavilion on the recreation ground along North
                    Trade Road.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was immediately apparent from the enthusiastic response
                    of local parents that a local playgroup was most urgently
                    required. The pavilion at that time was suitable, however
                    the location was not ideal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was quickly determined that our own building or premises
                    were needed. It is entirely due to the hard work and
                    dedication of the founder members that after some years,
                    funds were raised to purchase our present building.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has been extended over recent years through fund
                    raising events and support from various organisations to
                    provide disabled access, cloakroom facilities and an outdoor
                    floor surface with overhead canopy. Recently the small
                    garden has been remodelled and relaid with new turf.
